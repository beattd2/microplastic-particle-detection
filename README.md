# Microplastic Particle Detection 

Application designed to measure the prevalence of microplastics in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. Detects and measures the size of particles caught using a 330 micron net and photographed with an Olympus BX63 Fluorescence Microscope.

Takes as an imput:

  <img src="data/images/A.jpg" alt="Original Image" width="738">
</p>

Outputs a file with a bounding box around the predominant plastic particle:

  <img src="data/output/A/largest_particle_A.jpg" alt="Original Image" width="738">
</p>

And outputs a file with bounding boxes around all particles:

<p align="center">
  <img src="data/output/A/all_particles_A.jpg" alt="Original Image" width="738">
</p>

These photos can be used to manually measure the size of microplastic particles and their prevalence, but future versions will measure
these automatically.
